# Simple CMS

This is a very simple and fantastic CMS for loading, creating and modifying webpages. This was created for my personal website, as I didn't care for any of the available CMS. I wanted something as simple as logging in and clicking on the content I want to edit, so that's what Iv'e done! Its currently configured for a blog / projects page setup for my website but could be modified for your custom use easily. Keep in mind this is a very early stage of this system and lacks many many things.
